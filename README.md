Framework
 Project Title: PromptShield (Codename: SHIELD)
 Overview:
 Shield is a modular, Python-based framework designed to secure LLM (Large Language 
Model) integrations against prompt-based attacks, role injections, recursive commands, and 
semantic data leaks. Developed as a real-world implementable solution, Shield features a 
structured rules engine, configurable scanning layers, and logging capabilities tailored to both
 developers and enterprise deployments.
 Shield Enterprise expands the core capabilities with compliance-ready modules including 
GDPR-aware audit logging, SIEM integration, advanced policy filtering, and risk-based 
response handling.
 Core Modules (Shield):- Shield Wrapper (Python API / CLI)- Scanner Engine- Rules Engine (YAML/JSON based)- Action Engine (block, transform, log)- Response Evaluator (optional)- Security Logging Module
 Enterprise Add-ons (Shield Enterprise):- Advanced audit logging- Role-based policy filters- Risk scoring and output modulation- SIEM integration (Elastic, Splunk, Sentinel)- Policy-compliant redaction and pseudonymization
